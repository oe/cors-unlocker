## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

At CORS Unlocker, your privacy is our top priority. This policy explains how our browser extension operates and the important privacy considerations you should know about.

<InfoCard type="success" title="Zero Data Collection" icon="🔒">
We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data. All extension settings are stored locally on your device and never leave your browser.
</InfoCard>

## How We Protect Your Privacy

### 📱 Local Storage Only
All configuration settings, website permissions, and preferences are stored exclusively in your browser's local storage. No data is ever transmitted to external servers or third parties.

### 🔓 Open Source Transparency
Our extension is completely open source and available for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/oe/cors-unlocker). You can inspect every line of code to verify our privacy claims.

### 🚫 No Ads, No Tracking
CORS Unlocker is completely free and contains no advertisements, tracking scripts, or analytics. We're committed to providing a clean, distraction-free experience.

## Important Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Understanding Cross-Origin Risks">
When you enable CORS Unlocker for a website, that site gains the ability to access resources from other domains. This powerful capability comes with important privacy and security implications:
</Callout>

**🌐 Cross-Origin Access**
Enabled websites can fetch data from other domains that would normally be blocked by browser security policies.

**🔑 Authentication Sharing**
With "Site Auth" enabled, websites can access your logged-in sessions and authentication data from other sites.

### 🛡️ Best Practices for Safe Usage

<CompareCards leftTitle="Safe Practices" rightTitle="Avoid These Risks">
<div slot="left">

- Only enable for websites you trust completely
- Regularly review and clean up active permissions
- Use "Site Auth" sparingly and only when necessary
- Monitor extension activity in developer tools

</div>
<div slot="right">

- Enabling for untrusted or suspicious websites
- Using "Site Auth" on public or shared computers
- Leaving permissions active for unused sites
- Ignoring browser security warnings

</div>
</CompareCards>

## Your Rights and Controls
