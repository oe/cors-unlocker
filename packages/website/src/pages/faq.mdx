## How It Works

<details>
  <summary>🔧 How does the CORS Unlocker extension work?</summary>

CORS Unlocker simplifies cross-origin request management by intelligently modifying HTTP headers:

**🌐 Enable Data Loading**
Adds `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers to server responses, allowing your web application to fetch data from external APIs that would normally block cross-origin requests.

**🔐 Support Authentication**
When **Site Auth** is enabled, allows credentialed requests to include cookies and authentication headers for accessing protected resources.

## Configuration & Usage

## Known Limitations

<details>
  <summary>⚠️ What are the technical limitations of this extension?</summary>

<Callout type="error" title="Manifest V3 Limitations">
Due to browser security restrictions, some CORS scenarios cannot be resolved by extensions.
</Callout>

**🚫 Preflight Request Failures**

If the target server doesn't support OPTIONS requests or returns non-success responses for preflight requests, complex CORS requests will still fail. This affects:
- Requests with custom headers (not simple headers)
- Non-simple HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.)
- Requests with certain content types (application/json with custom headers)

**💡 Workaround:** Contact the API provider to properly implement CORS preflight support.

**🖼️ iframe and Embedded Content Issues**

The extension only works for the main page origin. If your request originates from:
- iframe elements
- Embedded widgets
- Web workers in different origins

You must enable CORS for the **iframe's origin**, not the parent page's origin.

**💡 Solution:** Use the extension popup while on the iframe's actual domain, or configure CORS for the correct origin.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>🐛 Why isn't the extension working?</summary>

**1️⃣ Extension Status**
Verify the extension is installed and enabled. Look for the CORS Unlocker icon in your browser toolbar.

**2️⃣ Protocol Support**
Only HTTP/HTTPS websites are supported. Local files (`file://`) and other protocols won't work.

**3️⃣ Origin Matching**
Ensure you've enabled the extension for the correct origin. Each domain needs separate activation.

**4️⃣ Extension Conflicts**
Other security extensions or ad blockers might interfere. Try disabling them temporarily to test.

## Security & Integration

<details>
  <summary>🛡️ Is the npm package integration secure?</summary>

<InfoCard type="success" title="User Control">
When websites request CORS access through our npm package, **you are always prompted to approve or deny** the request. You maintain complete control over which sites can access cross-origin resources.

**🔧 Management Features:**
- Real-time permission prompts for new requests
- Granular control per website/domain
- Easy permission revocation in extension options
- Complete audit trail of active permissions
