  <summary>What's Site Auth</summary>
**What does this setting do?**
This setting lets you choose how your browser shares information with websites. When enabled, the browser shares your login data (like cookies) with websites to help them recognize you and provide a more personalized experience. When disabled, your browser won’t share this data, keeping your activity more private.

**When should I turn this on?**  
- Turn it on if you need to log into a website or access features that require authentication.  
- For example, this is useful for online shopping, social media, or accessing member-only areas of websites.

**When should I turn this off?**  
- Turn it off if you’re browsing sensitive websites and want to avoid sharing login or personal data.  
- This is a safer option when visiting unfamiliar or untrusted websites.

**How does this affect my privacy?**  
- **Enabled:** Websites can recognize you and provide full features, but this may also share more of your personal data with them.  
- **Disabled:** Your privacy is better protected, but some websites may not work properly or require additional logins.
